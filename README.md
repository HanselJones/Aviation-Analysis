**About Dataset**
**Content**
The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.
Overview

This project aims to identify the lowest-risk aircraft for a company planning to enter the aviation industry by analyzing historical aviation accident data.
I utilized data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), covering accidents from 1962 to 2023.
The analysis involves data cleaning, imputation, visualization, and modeling to generate actionable insights.
My findings and recommendations are intended to assist the head of the new aviation division in making informed decisions about aircraft purchases
Business Problem The company seeks to diversify its portfolio by venturing into the aviation sector, specifically purchasing and operating aircrafts for commercial and private enterprises.They however lack expertise in assessing the risks associated with different aircraft types. My objective is to analyze historical accident data to determine which aircrafts are the safest, thereby minimizing potential risks and enhancing decision-making for aircraft procurement.
